# SecuriScan 

## Overview

**SecuriScan** is a tool designed to identify security vulnerabilities in web applications. This scanner performs an analysis of common security issues, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), outdated dependencies, and more. Ideal for developers and security professionals looking to ensure application integrity.

## Features

- **SQL Injection Detection**: Scans inputs for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **XSS Protection Testing**: Checks for cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
- **Dependency Vulnerability Detection**: Identifies outdated or vulnerable dependencies.
- **Report Generation**: Outputs a detailed report of detected vulnerabilities and recommended fixes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `scapy` (Install via `pip`)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/securiscan.git
   cd securiscan
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the scanner against a target URL:

```bash
python securiscan.py --url <target-url>
```

Options:
- `--url`: Target URL for the vulnerability scan.
- `--output`: Specify output format (`json` or `txt`).
- `--scan-type`: Choose specific scan types (`sql`, `xss`, `dependencies`).

Example:

```bash
python securiscan.py --url http://example.com --output report.txt --scan-type all
```

## Output

The scan results will be saved in the specified output format, detailing each detected vulnerability, its risk level, and suggested mitigation steps.
